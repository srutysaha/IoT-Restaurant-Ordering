# Smart Restaurant Menu Ordering System

The smart restaurant menu ordering system using Arduino consists of two main components: the Transmitter and the Receiver sections.

1. Transmitter Section:
 - Placed on the consumer's table.
 - Allows consumers to browse the restaurant's menu and place orders for dishes.
 - Provides an option to confirm the order once selections were made.

2. Receiver Section:
 - Placed at the order counter.
 - Receives the orders from the Transmitter section wirelessly.
 - Displays the received orders for the restaurant staff to process.

Overall, the Arduino-based smart restaurant menu ordering system aims to enhance the dining experience by streamlining the ordering process and reducing wait times
